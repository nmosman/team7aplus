# Code for LCD

## TODO:
- Position and resize the heart rate and heart animation
- Change animation values to look good
- Figure out what update rate to use for updating the heart rate 
(right now it's every 1s)
- Figure out how we're getting the heart rate from the main 
micro-controller
- Make sure the sprite & text don't interfere
